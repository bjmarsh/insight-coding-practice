    "Traditional arrays (like in C++) constist of fixed-sized elements stored in contiguous blocks of memory. E.g. an array of four 32-bit integers would be stored in 16 consecutive bytes of memory, 4 bytes per integer. This makes element retrieval very fast, but operations like insertions and deletions can be slow because large chunks of elements have to be shifted.\n",

    "This allows for faster insertions/deletions, because nothing has to be shifted in memory. Only the \"arrows\" pointing to the next element have to be re-arranged. E.g. the diagram below represents the array [12, 19, 37]. If we wanted to delete the middle node, we just have to make the arrow from the 12 node point directly to the 37 node.\n",

    "Below is a simple python implementation of a linked list. There is one class `ListNode` that represents a single node in the list, and a class `LinkedList` that holds the \"head\" of the list and implements a few useful functions.

    "## Hash tables\n",
    "Hash tables are a bit more complicated, and it's probably not necessary to know how to build one from scratch. But you should know the basic principles, and that in python `dict` and `set` objects are implemented as hash tables (a set is just a dictionary with no values, just keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "They allow  you to store arbitrary (key,value) pairs, and allow searching the keys and retrieving values in approximately constant time (as opposed to linear time, which would be the case if you just stored everything in a list).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, one first constructs a hash table of fixed size. Then, you determine a \"hash function\" that will map keys to an index in this table. In the below example, which maps \"keys\" of people's names to \"values\" of their phone numbers, the hash table has size 16. The hash function e.g. maps the name \"John Smith\" to the index 2, which allows us to retrieve the relevant value from the table. Note that evaluating this hash function does not depend on the number of (key,value) pairs, and so we can retrieve values in constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Hash_table_3_1_1_0_1_0_0_SP.svg/315px-Hash_table_3_1_1_0_1_0_0_SP.svg.png\" width=\"300px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "An obvious complication arises when two different keys get mapped by the hash function to the same index. This is known as a \"collision\", and requires special solutions. If there are lots of collisions relative to the size of your hash table, the lookup time can get a significant linear component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a very simple, non-optimal implementation of a hash table (in python, you'd probably never want to implement one yourself, just use a dict/set). It only accepts integers as keys, the hash table has size N, and the hash function is just `x -> x%N`. To get arround collisions, each entry in the hash table is actually a list that can hold arbitrary numbers of values. If the number of (key, value) pairs is much less than N, then there will be relatively few collisions and lookup time is ~$O(1)$. If the number of pairs is large compared to N, there will be lots of collisions and the lookup time will be ~$O(n)$."
